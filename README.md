# DEX Market Cap

In the spirit of decentralization, this is an attempt to build a trustless crypto market data aggregator that sources decentralized exchange data only. Centralized, custodial exchange APIs are notorious for serving stale, opaque, and inaccurate data, often manipulated by wash-trading and/or outright falsities.  

Planning to start listing exchanges supporting the [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) first and then going on from there.  

Built with Next.js and [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres) as the database.

## Live site

https://dex-market-cap.vercel.app/

## Local development

Git clone and copy the .env.example file in this directory to .env.local (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set the environment variables to match the ones in your Vercel Storage Dashboard.

Next, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
